# Node.JS Mud Client

Hi guys. That's a node.js-based [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) client.

In old times, like 15 years ago people used Tintin++ and JMC to play MUDs and script things. 

But Node.JS is a much better choice.

I wrote this tiny JS-scriptable MUD-client as a PoC in the memory of old MUDs:

- Solace MUD which I played so long ago (now works at telnet://solace.appcasion.com:4000, current setup tested on it).
- Dawn of Eternity (offline) where I was learning English writing Areas (nice ones, let me know if any other MUD wants them).

It can be used as a replacement of telnet or as a base of AI or toying with scripts, cause JavaScript is nice for it.

P.S. I do not plan to support/improve it. But you're free to fork & have that fun.
